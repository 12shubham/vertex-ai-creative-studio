            "prompt":"Create a 3D animated 'Trolls' character based on the uploaded photo. The character must embody the core 'Troll' aesthetic, but be deeply personalized using the following features from the photo:\n\n1.  **Age & Gender Presentation**: Infer the approximate age (e.g., child, adult) and perceived gender from the photo. Reflect these characteristics in the Troll's features, such as face shape, eye size, and expression, all within the cute 'Trolls' style. For example, an older person might inspire a troll with kind, crinkly eyes.\n\n2.  **Skin Tone & Ethnicity Inspiration**: Analyze the person's apparent ethnicity and specific skin tone from the photo. Use this as the primary inspiration for the Troll's vibrant, fantasy skin color. The goal is to create a color that feels harmonious and celebratory of the person's features, translated into the Trolls' world. **Do not match the human skin tone directly.** Instead, create a beautiful and fitting fantasy color.\n\n3.  **Hair Color**: Match the Troll's hair color to the primary hair color in the photo. For instance, if the person has brown hair, give the Troll vibrant brown hair. If they have blonde highlights, incorporate those as streaks of a lighter, more vibrant yellow/gold.\n\n4.  **Eye Color**: The Troll's eyes should be a sparkling, brighter version of the eye color from the photo.\n\n5.  **Key Accessories**: Incorporate a key accessory from the photo into the Troll's design. For example, if the person is wearing glasses, give the Troll a pair of brightly colored, oversized glasses. If they are wearing a hat, create a felt-like, scrapbook-style version for the Troll.\n\n6.  **Clothing**: The Troll must ALWAYS be wearing clothes. The clothes should fit the 'Trolls' universe aestheticâ€”think scrapbook style, made of felt, glitter, leaves, and other crafty materials. If the person in the photo is wearing a distinct top (like a t-shirt or jacket), use its color and style as inspiration for the Troll's outfit. If the clothing is not visible or clear in the photo, create a fun, original outfit (like a vest or a dress) for the Troll. Under no circumstances should the Troll be unclothed.\n\n7.  **Distinctive Features**: If the user has noticeable features like freckles, add a pattern of cute, slightly oversized freckles across the Troll's nose and cheeks. For a beard, replicate its style on the Troll. If the person has a full beard, create a lush, full, fuzzy beard for the Troll in the same color and texture as its hair. If it's a goatee or mustache, create a smaller, stylized version.\n\n8.  **Pose and Expression**: Capture the general pose and expression of the person in the photo. If they are smiling widely, the Troll should have a big, joyful grin.\n\nThe final output should ONLY be the image. Do not include any text, description or any other information.\n",
